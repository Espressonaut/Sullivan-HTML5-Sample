        <h1>Map Cash Flows</h1>
        <p>Cash Flow mappings are used to capture replacement reserve withdrawals and hard and soft principal payments. There are multiple ways the mappings are set up. The four main options are:</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">
                <div class="MCDropDown MCDropDown_Open dropDown"><span class="MCDropDownHead dropDownHead"><span class="MCDropDownHotSpot dropDownHotspot MCDropDownHotSpot_">Closing Balance of an Income/Expense Line Item - There is an income/expense line item for the cash flow.</span></span>
                    <div class="MCDropDownBody dropDownBody">
                        <p>Example: management company has a specific expense account ‘6900 Reserve Deposit’ to record their monthly replacement reserve deposits. (See AWI Management in Revere).</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <div class="MCDropDown MCDropDown_Open dropDown"><span class="MCDropDownHead dropDownHead"><span class="MCDropDownHotSpot dropDownHotspot MCDropDownHotSpot_">Closing Balance of a Specific Balance Sheet Line Item - The management company utilizes a specific line item on their balance sheet to track the cash flow.</span></span>
                    <div class="MCDropDownBody dropDownBody">
                        <p>Example: management company has an asset account '1321 Replacement Reserve Deposits’ that has solely the deposit activity. Then at year end the balance in the deposit, withdrawal, or principal payment account is booked to a main replacement reserve or mortgage account to start anew after year end. (See Belmont (AR) Replacement Reserve Deposits/Withdrawals in Revere)</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <div class="MCDropDown MCDropDown_Open dropDown"><span class="MCDropDownHead dropDownHead"><span class="MCDropDownHotSpot dropDownHotspot MCDropDownHotSpot_">Balance Sheet Debit/Credit Activity – The management company does not have either scenario 1 or 2, but has the monthly or year-to-date debit and credit activity for balance sheet line items linked to the cash flows</span></span>
                    <div class="MCDropDownBody dropDownBody">
                        <p> Example: management company has replacement reserve account ‘1320 Replacement Reserves’ and has listed the debit and credit activity which we are able to translate to the replacement reserve deposits and withdrawals. (See Boyd Management in Revere).</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li value="4">Group Account Mappings – management company does not have any scenarios 1 through 3, generally meaning the management company just reports ending balances for their line items. The user must identify the appropriate source accounts for the cash flows and utilize the ‘Group Account Mapping’ screen in Revere, so Revere can capture the monthly activity in the accounts and map it to the appropriate cash flow line item. (See Beacon Management in Revere).</li>
